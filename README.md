This project is a simple JavaScript animation using the HTML5 <canvas> element. The animation features bouncing balls that react to mouse movements and dynamically adjust their sizes.

Features
Bouncing Balls: Balls bounce around the canvas, influenced by gravity and collisions with canvas edges.
Mouse Interaction: Balls increase in size when the mouse hovers close to them.
Dynamic Canvas Resize: The canvas adjusts its size dynamically based on the window size.
